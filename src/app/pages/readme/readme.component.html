    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    This application contains all definitions of Cyberpunk 2077 as found with RTTI. You can search for enums, bitfields,
    classes, structs and global functions. For each classes and structs, you will find a list of their properties and
    functions. Furthermore, you can explore parent / child inheritance of classes and structs. Keep reading to learn
    more about some features.

    <mat-icon>search</mat-icon>
    <h2>Search</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    You can search in this database to filter enums, bitfields, classes, structs and functions. The list on the left
    will update itself as you type in. You can write multiple words to query content with an AND-like operation. You
    can write native and/or script names (also called aliases). It will search for both anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can choose what your query will search for. This icon <mat-icon>tune</mat-icon> provides a few options:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Name: default, query will run on the name of enums, bitfields, classes, structs and global functions.</li>
    <li>Property: query will run on the name of properties in classes and structs.</li>
    <li>Function: query will run on the name of functions in classes, structs and global functions.</li>
    <li>Usage: query will run on the name of types in classes, structs and global functions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you select property / function / usage, it will automatically filter the content of the class / struct you
    visit. You can show back all properties / functions by clicking on the <mat-icon>search</mat-icon> button.
  </p>

  <p id="search-by-usage">
    In the top-right corner of the page you visit, there is a <mat-icon>search</mat-icon> button. You can use it to
    automatically fill the search field with the name of the class / struct / enum / bitfield. It will also select the
    option Usage for you. This is a shortcut to quickly filter items in the left panel by usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can see items, in the left panel, with a <span class="stx-type disabled">darker color</span> to tell you
    "there is nothing to see". Whether its a class or a struct, it means there is no properties nor functions. However,
    it might still inherit from parents and/or be inherited by children. You can change this behavior in the settings.

    <h2>Navigate</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    You can easily navigate between definitions by clicking on their <span class="stx-type">name</span>. It won't work
    with primitive types such as <span class="stx-type">Float</span>, <span class="stx-type">CName</span>, etc.
  </p>

  @if (getGameInstance$ | async; as func) {
    <function-span [node]="func" [canCopy]="false" [canShare]="false"></function-span>
  }

  <p>
    A badge is a letter within a circle like above. It conveys information regarding metadata for functions, classes,
    etc. You can hover them to learn the exact meaning. Basically the letter is the letter of the first word with N for
    native, A for abstract, etc. The visibility of a property / function will be shown using colors like below:
  </p>

  <p class="scope">
    <mat-icon class="badge" data-scope="public" svgIcon="scope" title="public"></mat-icon>
    public
  </p>

  <p class="scope">
    <mat-icon class="badge" data-scope="protected" svgIcon="scope" title="protected"></mat-icon>
    protected
  </p>

  <p class="scope">
    <mat-icon class="badge" data-scope="private" svgIcon="scope" title="private"></mat-icon>
    private
  </p>

  <p>
    All definitions are using native names like <span class="stx-type">vehicleBaseObject</span>. But some also contains
    an alias name from scripts like <span class="stx-type">VehicleObject</span>. If you select <em>Redscript</em> as a
    code syntax in Settings, it will show aliases when possible. Independently of this option, the name will be
    <span class="stx stx-type stx-highlight">highlighted</span> to indicate there is a native/alias name. You can hover
    the name to show it in a tooltip, and click on it to copy the name in your clipboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Properties and functions are sorted by visibility first (public > protected > private) and then alphabetically.
  </p>

  <p>
    Functions are defined with a (short) name and a full name. Most of the time, both are equivalent, but not always.
    When a function is defined with a different full name, it will be
    <span class="stx stx-function stx-highlight">highlighted</span>. This is useful if you are writing a mod with C++
    or Lua. In both languages, you may have to use the full name. You can get it by clicking on a function's name to
    copy the full name to your clipboard. Here an example:
  </p>

  @if (addFact$ | async; as func) {
    <function-span [node]="func" [canCopy]="false" [canShare]="false"></function-span>
  }

  <p>
    List of shortcuts you should know about to improve your experience:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="keyboard">CTRL</span> + <span class="keyboard">CLICK</span> /
      <span class="keyboard">⌘</span> + <span class="keyboard">CLICK</span> /
      <span class="keyboard">Middle Mouse Button</span> to open the page of a <span class="stx-type">definition</span>
      in a new tab / window.
    </li>

    <li>
      <span class="keyboard">U</span> + <span class="keyboard">CLICK</span> to use the
      <a href="/readme#search-by-usage">search-by-usage</a> feature on a definition's <span class="stx-type">name</span>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Finally, you can customize other behaviors of your navigation in the settings.

    You can reference any part of this database using the URL in your browser. All URIs are unique and will always point

    You can bookmark any enum, bitfield, class, struct or global function. Use this icon
    <mat-icon>bookmark_border</mat-icon> to bookmark / un-bookmark. You can take a look at all your bookmarks on this
    page <button mat-icon-button

    <h2>Grab code</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    You can copy content of this database to your clipboard when you see this icon <mat-icon>content_copy</mat-icon>. It
    will copy the declaration you want to extract based on its type. But you might work with Redscript, Lua or C++...
    Different languages means different syntax. You can configure the current language you wish to use in the settings.
    You can change it whenever you wish. So, after defining Lua, every time you use the grab icon, it will copy content
    to your clipboard using Lua syntax.

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    You can write documentation for classes and structs. You can add documentation on a class or a struct to describe
    its purpose. You can add documentation on any functions of a class or a struct.
  </p>

  <p>
    This button <mat-icon>info_outline</mat-icon> allows you to show / hide the documentation. By default, it will show
    you a form to start writing right-away. You can save, cancel or delete your documentation. When there is already
    some content, the button will look like this <mat-icon class="stx-doc">info_outline</mat-icon>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your documentation is saved in your browser only. However, you can export it to a file on your device. You can
    import it back from elsewhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    The documentation's format is made in such a way that you can merge your documentation with files from others. A
    tool will popup to let you select what you want to merge.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is generally better to follow some guidelines when writing documentation. This will allow you to write clear and
    concise information. Which will be good for you and others to keep consistent descriptions. Here are some tips you
    can follow by clicking on this button <button mat-icon-button
                                                  class="inline"
                                                  title="Guidelines"
                                                  (click)="openGuidelines()"><mat-icon>help_outline</mat-icon></button>.
    This button is always present in the form used to write documentation. It also contains some explanation on the
    custom syntax you can use.
